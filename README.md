# ROS2 Workspace
Workspace for `CMPT720` running **ROS2 Humble**
- Fork of https://github.com/athackst/vscode_ros2_workspace/tree/humble

In this course, we use Docker together with VS Code Dev Containers to provide a consistent and reliable development environment for ROS 2.
Robotics software is particularly sensitive to differences in system configuration, and this approach helps us avoid many common issues.

## Dev Container Setup
1. Make sure Docker, VS Code, and VS Code Remote Containers extension are installed. See [Docker Setup](#docker-setup)
2. Clone this the `cmpt720_sp26` branch of this repo

```bash
git clone -b cmpt720_sp26 git@github.com:SFU-MARS/ros2_ws.git
```

2. See [these instructions](https://github.com/SFU-MARS/ros2_tutorial/wiki/Building-and-using-the-dev-container)

3. See [this article](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode-docker-ros2.html) for deeper insight

## Docker Setup
Before proceeding, ensure the following are installed on your system:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [VS Code Remote Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)


### Docker Post-Installation (Linux)

To run Docker without sudo and allow VS Code to connect to containers, follow the official Docker post-installation steps:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

Summary:
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

## To run Gazebo GUI on Windows (Docker)

This workspace supports running the Gazebo GUI on **Windows 11/10 with WSLg** using Docker Desktop and VS Code Dev Containers.

### Requirements
- make sure the Windows come with **WSL2 + WSLg enabled**
  * Verify WSLg is working by running this in your WSL terminal (not from the container):
    ```bash
    glxinfo | grep OpenGL
    ```
    - this should give you OpenGL vendor and render info. Otherwise, you should first enable WSLg following this: https://github.com/microsoft/wslg
- **Docker Desktop** (WSL backend)
- **VS Code** with **Dev Containers** extension

### Steps
1. Make sure we are using the right devcontainer config file:
   ```sh
   mv .devcontainer/devcontainer.json .devcontainer/devcontainer.json.bk  # backup
   mv .devcontainer/wsl-devcontainer.json .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
   ```
2. Open this workspace in VS Code
3. Rebuild container: press `F1` → **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**
4. Wait for the container to build and attach
5. Inside the container terminal, launch Gazebo:
   ```bash
   gazebo  --verbose
   ```

### Notes

* GUI support is enabled via WSLg socket mounting points and environment variables defined in `mounts` and `containerEnv`:

  ```
  .devcontainer/wsl-devcontainer.json
  ```

* This configuration forces **software OpenGL rendering**, if Gazebo opens but shows a black window or renders slowly:

  ```json
  "LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE": "1"
  ```
